# Introduction
- We have been  looking for delivering the right system for identification of people allowing to reach the UN Sustainable Goal objective of registering identity for all including birth registration, 
- We have seen so far promising initiatives and progresses, but we still see we don't make it really, so we have decided to be leading an action for making it happening
- So we have decided to start a new Digital Public Good for Identity Registration from birth.

# Objectives
- We are starting that by drafting the specification of what should do that new DPG and share it on GitHub to get contributions and build a community.
- The idea is to offer new options to countries which are looking for sovereignty though an Open Standard based solutions which will include Open-Source components but could also welcome proprietary implementation and which are willing to address the SDG16:9.
- A further step could be to create a modular Identity and Authentication Building Block composed of a set of modular lightweight components which would deal with Identity Registration and Authentication including registration from birth.

# Principles
- **Inclusive**: There will be no reasons preventing a registration to be done
- **Accessible**: The solution will be designed to be accessible even by the last mile people
- **Low-tech**: Accessible technologies will be considered when possible (ie 2G, feature phones)
- **Offline**: The solution will be always available offline of will leverage on 2G/3G networks when possible
- **One-stop-shop** : enable one-stop-shop application, no need to come several time
- **Mobile**: As much mobile as mobile, leveraging on smartphones but also on feature phones
- **Sustainable**: The solution will be based on Open Standard and will exist as an Open Source solution.
- **Modular**: The solution will have identified modules which will be switchable
- **Interoperable**: The solution will leverage on Open Standards in between the building blocks
- **Open-Source**: the solution will be Open-Source BUT could welcome proprietary software as soon they respect the interoperability
- **Cost effective**: minimize cost of customization and deployment, minimize infrastructure footprint
- **Sovereign**: With specific focus on not requiring high technical skills, also developing local technical skills and procurement skills.

# Non profit / Digital public good
We are doing that on our spare time without expecting income for it and looking for developers or partner companies to help us making it a reality also investors to support its implementation and integration into the target user countries. 
You can locate the draft specification on this GitHub, feel free to read, comment and most of all contribute.

# Overall vision of a Government stack

## Evolution of Identity management
This represent vision of what should be next step of identity digitalization, schema below shows the evolution in time of identity management;

## What is the current transformation ?

### Classical systems in Silos
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41069593/138833063-b1354993-2a38-4f29-a20b-2466d576e4fa.png)

Challenges
- Systems are built in Silos
- Duplication of technologies
- Expensive whole system in each silo
- Proprietary compatibility are built
- Vendor Lock-in in each silo
- Technologies are heterogeneous
- Multiple digital identities allow fraud
- Multiple-stop shop Citizen’s experience

### Foundational ID started to break the silos!

Challenges and progresses
- Systems are built in Silos but **ID is transversal**
- Duplication of technologies
- Expensive whole system in each silo
- Vendor Lock-in in each silo **apart in ID**
- Proprietary compatibility are built, **Identity verification is interoperable**
- Technologies are heterogeneous
- **Unique Identity reduce fraud**
- Multiple-stop shop Citizen’s experience **around same Identity**

### Foundational ID is one layer of the  Government Stack

Benefits
- Systems are built in cross-entities stacks
- Convergence of technologies
- Global savings for all entities 
- Vendor Lock-in minimized
- Whole system become interoperable
- Technologies are homogeneous
- Digital ID usable anywhere 
- One shop Citizen’s experience

## Foundational ID to be part of Government Stack for Government as a service platform 

### Benefits

Benefit of this approach
- Fast-track government digitalization
- State is sovereign on its digital infrastructure
- Vendor lock-in mitigated to components micro procurements (more choice, cost reductions, ..)
- Capacity to build internal shared pool of digital skills
- Rationalize investment on common assets
- Global internal and external Interoperability
- Value-added services to citizens and private sector
- From rule-based policies to data-based policies
- Citizen as a user / Government as a service approaches

## Typical open Government stack design
An orchestrator manages business workflows built around the citizen accross the systems of the state using technical components for the various actions/interactions required.

This architecture can setup an inclusive digital identity from birth and ensure access to one-stop-shop services to the population.

## The importance of Open-Standards

- Open Standards allow to facilitate integration of components provided by multiple vendors.
  - They are designed and agreed in between professionals from their various experiences
  - They are usable by small or new players like startups or small local company fostering innovation and supporting development of local digital capacities.
  - They are better than narrowed standards defined by dominant players bringing to un-adapted to country specific use cases.
- An example of Open Standard developed for Identity System is OSIA, more should be developed to cover the whole digital infrastructure.

## Thinking ‘Building Blocks’
Interoperability will split the system in independent interconnected building blocks each of them in charge of a specific function in the overall system.
Some components will be technical building blocks offering a technical capacity like identity authentication, interaction with population, money transfer, … they will be common to the whole system.
Some components will be business building blocks in charge to handle business processes and interactions for a specific function like education, health, social security, management of foreigners... They will be independent systems using the technical building blocks.

## Opportunity of Digital Public Goods
Rather than building proprietary software components for each silo, it makes sense to put in common country efforts and spending in building common components.
That trend is currently growing fast and now extending to cross-countries collaboration which are co-investing on building blocks they all needs and sharing for free the one they have already.
Digital Public Goods are often Open-Source in order to make the user state sovereign on them.
It’s important to keep the door open to interoperable private sector solutions which will bring in professionalism and experience, but their value is now transitioning for on-the-shelves solutions to capacity to deliver professional services.
