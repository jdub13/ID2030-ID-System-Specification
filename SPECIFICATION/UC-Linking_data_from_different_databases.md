The following are the requirements for linking data from different databases

| Personal data tracking      | Unlinking data sources          |     | Use of alias numbers allows to prevent an external system to link personal data from different sources and perform tracking ofÂ  a person. Only the central system is capable to link the different identifiers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                  |
| Personal data tracking      | Linking data source             |     | The central system can offer to an authorized service provider the capacity to resolve the identity of a person, by collecting for him data across the different systems without at any moment sharing the functional identifiers (alias or token) to the service provider. This mechanism is based on a combination between the Identifier management system and the Data Mediation building block.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                  |
| Anonymization of identities | CCTV system                     |     | A CCTV system can be based uniquely on token functional number without having to know the identity of persons, there can be white list and black list of people in the CCTV system which are just referring to random numbers. In case an authorized person need actually to control who's a person captured on CCTV system, a central system storing the identity data linked to the alias number can disclose the identity. The benefits is hacking the CCTV system won't bring any information, he will be limited to its functional scope and can be reattached to other personal data in other system. |                  |
| Personal data tracking      | Decentralization of identifiers |     | In prevent even more the traceability of person across databases the functional system could store themselves the token numbers which would be different from the functional numbers, preventing a central system hack to disclose all functional numbers attached together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                  |
