# Introduction
- We have been  looking for delivering the right system for identification of people allowing to reach the UN Sustainable Goal objective of registering identity for all including birth registration, 
- We have seen so far promising initiatives and progresses, but we still see we don't make it really, so we have decided to be leading an action for making it happening
- So we have decided to start a new Digital Public Good for Identity Registration from birth.
